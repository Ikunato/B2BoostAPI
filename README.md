# B2BoostAPI
Short API realised for B2Boost


Tests aren't done.
I have a problem with H2. The db is created but no data is inserted.

I don't know why I took so much time doing it. I hope in 3 months I can do some trivial stuff like this way easier.
Also, I used Spring Boot because I was unable to use Grails.
